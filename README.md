## 📊 **The Merits of a Voting Rule Based on θ-Winning Sets**  

### Project Status: On Hiatus 😴

### ❔ What Did I Do:
- Developed a novel voting rule, **Greatest θ-Winning Set**, that outperforms traditional methods (e.g., Plurality, Borda Count) in fairness metrics.  
- Conducted empirical studies on single and multi-winner elections, showcasing the rule's adaptability.  
- Presented findings at the SSRI Poster Symposium.  

### 📌 Key Takeaways:
- **Condorcet Criterion**: Satisfies the principle by always selecting the most preferred candidate(s).
- **Metric Distortion**: Lowest metric distortion of any compared voting rule.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts seamlessly to multi-winner elections, ensuring fairness in diverse scenarios.  

### 🔮 Future Work:
- **Publication/Thesis**: I believe these results are good enough for a publication or honors thesis, and if I do pick up this project again, that is the direction I will go in.

## 🎮 **AI-Driven Gameplay in VizDoom**  
### Project Status: In Development! 💻

### ⌛ Timeline So Far:
- Started by creating a **custom VizDoom-Gym environment** to train agents using reinforcement learning.
- Developed a **custom reward shaping system** that promotes efficient strategies, penalizes wasted resources, and rewards goal-oriented actions.  
- Created a model that could easily succeed in the [Defend The Center](https://vizdoom.farama.org/environments/default/#defend-the-center) scenerio.
- Moved on to **evolutionary computation methods**, as reinforcement learning with ViZDoom has already been thoroughly explored.
- Currently training the bot to succeed in the [My Way Home](https://vizdoom.farama.org/environments/default/#my-way-home) scenerio using ACO.

### 👀 Future Plans:
- Will go back to Defend The Center, and solve it with visual information + NEAT.
- Plan on combining this with my ACO framework to beat the E1M1 in the original DOOM :godmode:.

## 🤖 **Learning Isolated Individual Leg Control on a Hexapod**  
### Project Status: In Development! 💻

### ⌛ Timeline So Far:
- Created 3 different GA's to evolve controllers for the [Mantis](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis?version=R2021a) robot in WeBots.
- Applied these GA's to multiple different modifications of the Mantis scenario, including modifying the weight and disabling legs.
- Tracked, plotted, and compared the fitness values of the controllers evolved.

### 👀 Future Plans:
- Collaborating on a paper based off this work that will be submitted to ______ (can't reveal conference until accepted).
